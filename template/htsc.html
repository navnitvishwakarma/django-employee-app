    <h2>🌟 Practical Ways to Stay Creative</h2>
    <h3>1. Make Time for Ideas</h3>
    Schedule creative time just like meetings or chores. Even 15 minutes daily can spark new thoughts.

    Use this time for sketching, writing, or simply daydreaming.

<h3>2. Clear Mental Clutter</h3>
    Journaling: Write down random thoughts, questions, or doodles to free up mental space.

    Mindfulness/meditation: Spend 5–10 minutes in quiet reflection each morning to reset your mind.

<h3>3. Seek Diverse Inspiration</h3>
    Read books, articles, or poetry outside your field to expose yourself to new perspectives.

    Attend workshops, exhibitions, or listen to podcasts in different domains.

<h3>4. Capture Fleeting Ideas</h3>
    Carry a notebook or use a notes app to jot down ideas immediately.

    Many great innovations start as small, random thoughts.

<h3>5. Manage Digital Distractions</h3>
    Limit social media scrolling and notifications during creative work.

    Use focus apps or set “no‑screen” hours to protect your creative energy.

<h3>6. Experiment with Mind Mapping</h3>
    Visualize connections between ideas using diagrams or digital tools.

    Helps you see patterns and generate new concepts.

<h3>7. Collaborate and Share</h3>
    Brainstorm with friends or colleagues — fresh perspectives often unlock new directions.

    Feedback can refine and expand your ideas.

    <h2>⚡ Daily Creative Routine Example</h2>
    <h3>Morning (10 min): Meditation or journaling.

    Afternoon (15 min): Read something unrelated to your work.

    Evening (20 min): Mind map or brainstorm on a problem.

    Anytime: Capture ideas in a notebook or app.</h3>

<h2>🚨 Watch Out For Creativity Killers</h2>
<h3>Overwork: Exhaustion blocks imagination. Rest is essential.

    Perfectionism: Don’t wait for the “perfect” idea — start small and refine later.

    Isolation: Too much solitude can limit inspiration. Balance solo work with collaboration.</h3>
